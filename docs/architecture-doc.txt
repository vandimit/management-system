# Record Management System Architecture

This document details the architectural design of the Record Management System, which follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

## MVC Architecture

The application is divided into three main components:

### Model

The Model component represents the data and business logic of the application. It:
- Manages data access and storage
- Implements business rules and validation
- Handles persistence (loading/saving data)
- Is independent of the user interface

#### Key Classes:
- `RecordModel`: Base class that provides common functionality
- `ClientModel`: Manages client records
- `AirlineModel`: Manages airline records
- `FlightModel`: Manages flight records

### View

The View component manages the user interface elements. It:
- Renders data from the Model in a suitable format
- Captures user input and interactions
- Forwards user actions to the Controller
- Updates the UI when data changes

#### Key Classes:
- `RecordManagementGUI`: Main application window and UI components
- Contains tab frames for clients, airlines, and flights
- Uses Tkinter for all UI elements

### Controller

The Controller component mediates between Model and View. It:
- Processes input from the View
- Updates the Model based on user actions
- Triggers View updates when the Model changes
- Contains application logic for responding to user actions

#### Key Classes:
- `ClientController`: Manages client-related operations
- `AirlineController`: Manages airline-related operations
- `FlightController`: Manages flight-related operations

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the View (e.g., clicks a button)
2. View passes the action to the Controller
3. Controller processes the request and updates the Model if needed
4. Model performs data operations and returns results
5. Controller receives the results and triggers View updates
6. View refreshes to display the updated data

## Communication Between Components

- The View has a reference to the Controller
- The Controller has a reference to the Model
- The Controller has a callback reference to the View update methods
- The Model does not directly reference the View or Controller

## Data Persistence

- Records are stored in JSON format
- The Model is responsible for loading and saving data
- The file structure is:
  ```json
  {
      "Client": [
          { /* client data */ },
          { /* client data */ }
      ],
      "Airline": [
          { /* airline data */ },
          { /* airline data */ }
      ],
      "Flight": [
          { /* flight data */ },
          { /* flight data */ }
      ]
  }
  ```

## UI Design

The application uses a tabbed interface with three main sections:
- Client Management
- Airline Management
- Flight Management

Each tab provides:
- A form for entering record data
- Buttons for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- A table view of all records
- Search functionality

## Error Handling

- Input validation occurs in the Controller
- The Model provides data consistency checks
- User feedback is displayed through the View
- A status bar shows current application state

## Testing Strategy

- Models are tested in isolation with direct data manipulation
- Controllers are tested with mock Models and Views
- Views are tested for proper rendering and event handling
- Integration tests verify the components work together
